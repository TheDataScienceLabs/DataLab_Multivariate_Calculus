# Introduction

Welcome to The Data Science Labs on Multivariable Calculus!

This is a one-credit companion course for students in Calculus 3. We will learn applications of multivariable calculus in data science and get hands-on practice with microcontrollers, such as the Raspberry Pi Pico, and a variety of accessory sensors.
