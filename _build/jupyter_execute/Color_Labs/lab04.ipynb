    "We've done a lot of theoretical work about color from learning about tristiulus vectors and metamers, but now let's investigate a use for the RGB color space. The TCS3472 sensor we will be using can detect color and returns an RGB value. The sensor contains an infrared (IR) blocking filter for increased accuracy. IR light is light that has wavelengths of 800-1000 nm; it is invisible to us since humans only percieve wavelengths in the 400-700 nm range. "

    "It's long been debated whether different color M&Ms taste different [[1]](https://www.mashed.com/748770/the-absolute-best-desserts-in-the-us/). Let's say you have a friend who is color blind who wants to test this theory themselves, but it's a challenge to sort red from green from brown M&Ms. To solve this critial problem, your goal is to create an M&M sorter using your Pico and the TCS3472 color sensor. Connect the color sensor and an OLED display to your Pico. When you hold up an M&M to the sensor, the screen should display the name of the color of the M&M.\n",
