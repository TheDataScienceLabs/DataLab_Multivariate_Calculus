# # Laboratory Ethics
# 
# "I pledge to behave ethically and with honesty in this course. I may discuss approaches for a solution with others, but my submitted lab report will be my own work, including all
# code. I will not make my finished reports available to other students, even after the semester is over. In particular, I will not post my labs on the Internet or make my files available to other people. I will not be a cheater."
