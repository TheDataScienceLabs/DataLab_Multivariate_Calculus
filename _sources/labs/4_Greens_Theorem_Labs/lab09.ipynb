Suppose the region $D$ is bounded by a simple, smooth, closed curve $C$ which is parameterized in a counter-clockwise direction.

    "\n",
    "One really neat application of Green's Theorem is that we can calculate the area of a region simply by measuring the boundary. A planimeter is an instrument that does exactly this! The first planimeters were invented as early as 1814 due to a need to calculate land area. In the late 19th century, planimeters became more popular, different internal mechanisms were developed, and even specialty planimeters emerged to calculate things like engine horse-power. More modern uses include finding leaf area in botany and measuring the area of cross-sectional regions from MRI images. All planimeters have a tracer point, a pivot point, and a measuring wheel or mechanism that measures rotation. Here are some examples.\n",

    "The left image is of a polar planimeter. It has two arms and is fixed at one end while the arm with the tracer point is able to move in a circular region around the fixed point. The center image is of a rolling planimeter. This kind of planimeter is able to move freely on a linear path. The right image is of a modern rolling planimeter that is still being produced. \n",
    "\n",
    "Watch this 18 second [animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qThV6gTaYMI) of a rolling planimeter. Notice that the gray roller only moves forward and backward on a fixed path, and the yellow arm pivots at the point $B$. As the arm pivots, the marked wheel at the back rotates and skids as the tracer point at $A$ follows the red curve. As the tracer follows the curve the marked wheel will rotate some amount. We will prove that the area of the region is length of the tracer arm (the length from $A$ to $B$) multiplied by the total rolling distance of the wheel after the tracer completely follows the curve counter-clockwise."
