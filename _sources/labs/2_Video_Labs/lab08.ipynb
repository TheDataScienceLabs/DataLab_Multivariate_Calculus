    "\n",
    "The assumption that $f(x+\\Delta x,y+\\Delta y,t+\\Delta t)=f(x,y,t)$ is reasonable for most situations. However, if there is a lot of change from frame to frame, for example a helicopter-mounted camera undergoing strong vibrations, then our results will not be as good. In 2003, Gunnar Farneback proposed a solution to this problem. To fully explain his method, a good knowledge of linear algebra and least squares minimization is necessary, but we will give a general overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind Farneback's algorithm for calculating optimal flow is:\n",
    "- Starting with the previous frame, reduce the resolution of the image.\n",
    "- Estimate the values of a small patch of pixels with a quadratic polynomial (like how we did polynomial interpolation in 1 dimension but this is in 2 dimensions).\n",
    "- In the next frame, do the same quadratic estimation.\n",
    "- With the 2 simplified quadratic functions, it's \"easy\" to calculate the displacement of the patch of pixels (this is where the linear algebra and least squares minimization comes into play).\n",
    "- Increase the resolution of the frame and repeat the process again. \n",
    "\n",
    "By repeating on higher and higher resolution images, we are able to capture both big and small displacements. After refining how much displacement there is between the two frames, the result is $\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$ and $\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta t}$ for each pixel in the image, so we call this type of process dense optimal flow.
