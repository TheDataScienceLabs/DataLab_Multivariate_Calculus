The [Data Science Labs](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~mboutin/Data_Science_labs.html) on Multivariate Calculus 
is a companion course for students in Calculus 3 who have completed Calculus 1 & 2. 
Students learn applications of multidimensional data and get hands-on practice with 
microcontrollers, such as the Raspberry Pi Pico, and a variety of accessory sensors.
