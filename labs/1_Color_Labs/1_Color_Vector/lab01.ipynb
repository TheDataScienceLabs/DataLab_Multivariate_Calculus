    "Colors in Python can be specified by a red, green, and blue channel value. Each number is an integer between 0-255 and represents the intensity of red, blue, and green light that is mixed together to produce the resulting color. To display the color, we can use Matplotlib's `imshow()` function. The input to this function is a multi-dimensional array that contains information about the size of the image and the color of each pixel. Let's print just one red pixel. That means our image is size $1 \\times 1$ and the color we've chosen is the vector $[255,0,0]$. In the following code cell, the variable `img` has shape $(1,1,3)$; the first two dimensions give the number of rows and the number of columns of pixels. The third dimension is 3, which tells us that `img` is a $1 \\times 1$ array where each entry is a length 3 array."

Since these pulses of light alternate on and off so quickly, we only see a uniform brightness. The time between pulses determines the intensity of the color. For a half-strength red (127,0,0), the LEDs are still switching from off to full red (255,0,0), but the LED is on for an equal amount of time that it is off. \n",

We can simulate a 50% duty cycle by creating an animation with the library Matplotlib.
