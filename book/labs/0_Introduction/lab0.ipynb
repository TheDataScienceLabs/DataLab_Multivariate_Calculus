To do this, navigate to the *Home* directory and add a new folder by right-clicking. Name the folder something that will be easy to find, such as \"DSLab_Calc3.\" If you'd like to put it at the top of the list of folders and make it even easier to find, add a tilde (~) at the beginning of the name you chose.\n",

This includes files that are downloaded through links during labs. When you click on a file link, it'll send you to the GitHub page for that file. To download and save it to your folder, click on the button that says \"Raw\" on the top right of the file preview (unless it's a PDF, then just click \"Download\"). This will take you to a white page with the information in black text. To see the file in the proper environment, right-click the screen and click \"Save as...\" and once you open it after this, it should appear in the correct environment!\n",
