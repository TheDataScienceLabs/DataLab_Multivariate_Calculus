The specific microcontroller we will use is called the Raspberry Pi Pico. The Raspberry Pi Pico runs a different version of Python called Micropython. Micropython is designed specifically for microcontrollers. It does not have many of the modules you are used to, like numpy, since the Pico does not have enough memory or processing power to make good use of them. Instead, it has libraries for interfacing with hardware, like the machine library we will use to control the pins on the Pico. Also, the time library in Micropython supports millisecond and microsecond sleep functions, which can count out much more precise units of time than you can in normal Python.\n",

The level shifter is in charge of translating between the voltage levels, which is why it has a low voltage side connected to 3V3, and a high voltage side connected to VBUS (which refers to the USB cable). We only need to do level shifting to two pins, and it is good practice to connect pins you are not using to ground."

Since these pulses of light alternate on and off so quickly, we only see a uniform brightness. The time between pulses determines the intensity of the color. For a half-strength red (127,0,0), the LEDs are still switching from off to full red (255,0,0), but the LED is on for an equal amount of time that it is off. \n",

We can simulate a 50% duty cycle by creating an animation with the library Matplotlib.

From the table of values in the file *color_matching.txt*, we know that $r(665)=0.995, g(665)=.005$, and $b(665)=0$, so in order to match a light composed of only the wavelength 665 nm, we need of 99.5% of the 630.7 nm primary, 0.5% of the 528.6 nm primary, and none of the third primary in our mixture."
