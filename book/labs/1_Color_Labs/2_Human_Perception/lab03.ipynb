    "You may be wondering why we have been describing color with only 3 values. Why not 2 or 4? The reason is rooted in the anatomy of our eyes. There are three different types of receptors in the human eye called cones or cone cells. One cone type is more sensitive to longer wavelengths (560 nm), another to medium wavelengths (530 nm), and the other to short wavelengths (420 nm). This biological stucture of the eye is the basis of the trichromatic theory of color and allows us to describe color in terms of vector spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a trichromatic model, the sensor, such as your eye or a camera, is charactrized by three spectral response functions. The experiments by Wright and Guild indirectly measured these response functions for the human visual system. Eventually, in the 2000's, Stockman, Sharpe and Fach [[ref1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698900000213)[[ref2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698998002259) measured the actual cone spectral sensitivity. Their experiemental values are in the file *cone_responses.csv*. The file extension csv stands for comma-separated values. If you open the csv file, you will see commas separating 4 values in each row. The first column is wavelength $\\lambda$ in nanometers. The second column is the spectral sensitivity $Q_L(\\lambda)$ of the L-cones. The third column is the spectral sensitivity $Q_M(\\lambda)$ of M-cones. The second column is the spectral sensitivity $Q_S(\\lambda)$ of S-cones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercise you will fill in code to plot the three functions. Note that there are no values of $Q_S(\\lambda)$ available after $\\lambda=$ 615 nm from the experimental data, but we can effectively set those missing values to zero.  "

A given type of cone cell reacts to a large spectrum of wavelengths, but in different amounts for different frequencies. For example, the L-cones react a lot more at 430 nm (the peak of their corresponding curve on the graph) than to 400 nm. So if the human eye is seeing the color blue at a wavelength of, say, 453 nm, then the L-cones have a high response, while the M and S cells have a small response.\n",
