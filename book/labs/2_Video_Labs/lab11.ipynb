In this lab, you will be combining the capabilities of both sensors. As the Arducam HM01B0 doesn't pick up color, only shades of gray, you cannot detect color with it, that is, unless, you know what colors the grayscale values line up with. \n",

    "During the M&M color detection lab, you were able to display the color of the individual M&M being held in front of the color sensor. However, this method would be inefficient in the case of having a pile of M&Ms, as you would need to individually hold each one up and sort them one-by-one. But with the camera, you can detect multiple instances at the same time as it's picking up a field of vision rather than just one point. Using this functionality will help in picking out specific colors in a pile.\n",
