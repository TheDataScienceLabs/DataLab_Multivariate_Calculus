Here is a rough outline of what needs to be done for the first planimeter lab (week 12).

- Give instructions on how to wire up/assemble the planimeter

- Have them print out a PDF (we need to make this) with some geometric shapes of known areas. These should include:

	- a square, so that they can measure the side lengths to find the area and calibrate their planimeter
	- a circle with a diameter equal to the square sidelength, so that they can predict what the planimeter will read and check their answer.
	- a complicated geometric shape composed of simpler shapes, so they can compare the methods of finding the area.
	- a curved region which they don't have another way to compute
	- a plot of the curve y=e^(-x^2) between 0 and 1, with vertical lines at 0 and 1, with an equal aspect ratio.
	
Besides that, we still need to make sure the planimeter is working as expected (giving answers to a reasonable degree of precision). You may have to try a couple surfaces to run it on, since some tables are too grippy. If it is really not working, we can change to geometry to give it a better shot at success. An example bit of code is provided to get readings off the potentiometer.
