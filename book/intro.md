# Introduction
## The Data Science Labs on Multivariable Calculus
**By Kindyl King and Mireille Boutin with Alden Bradford**

Welcome to MA29000, The Data Science Labs on Multivariable Calculus! This is a one credit course to accompany Calculus 3, during which you will discover applications of multivariable calculus to data science. You will also practice programming in Python and using Arduino sensors and microprocessors to acquire data.

This course requires no work outside of the lab, including no homework, no quizzes, no tests, and no exams. All work is performed during the 150 minutes spent in the lab each week. Calculus 3 is a co-requisite for taking this course. MA16290 is a pre-requisite, but it can be waived if you have experience in Python.

Fall 2022 schedule:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Tuesday 5:30-8:00 P.M. CRN 27738

Purdue students: You can earn Honors credit for Calculus 3 by taking this lab. See syllabus for details.

## How to Get Started

You are reading an interactive Notebook written in the Jupyter language. Jupyter allows for a collection of files to be neatly compiled into a single web-page, such as the one you're looking at. It also allows you to write and compile Python code. 

The application that is used to make these Notebooks is JupyterLab, which is what you'll be using to interact with and edit the labs. 

To get started with this course, click the next arrow at the bottom left of this page to get to Laboratory 1. This lab will explain how to interact with the Notebook, including running code, editing cells, and other useful features that can be used in Jupyter. Throughout the lab, you will be asked to perform some exercises. You will write your answers directly in the Notebook. In other words, you will need to edit the lab file. In order to edit the lab, we recommend downloading the file and opening it in JupyterLab.

To begin editing this lab, click on the download icon in the top right of the screen and download the *.ipynb* version of Lab 0. After this, open the JupyterLab application. This will bring you to a screen with files and a Table of Contents on the left side and a screen on the right side. If not already open, open the files directory by clicking on the folder icon in the top left corner. Open the *Downloads* file, double-click *lab_0.ipynb*, and follow the directions in this lab to begin.

To turn in the labs on Brightspace, you will have to export the file as a PDF. To do this, navigate to *File*, *Save and Export Notebook as*, and then click on *PDF*. This will be further explained in Laboratory 0.

If you have any questions or are experiencing any difficulties during these labs, please ask your TA for assistance.
