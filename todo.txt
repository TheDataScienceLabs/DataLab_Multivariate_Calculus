New to do (07/08/2022):
Motion Lab:
    - Add camera instructions and wiring
Planimeter Lab:
    - Figure out how to make a simple planimeter
Final Project:
    - Add example projects
Make Notebook public and compile automatically
Missing 2 weeks worth of labs
Gait labs need to be made or replaced


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfinished Labs: gait analysis

All Labs: 
    - try each lab
    - log how long it takes to complete
    - make suggestions on where to lengthen/cut sections
    - revisit vector notation (less urgent)

Color Lab 1:
    - add pictures of hardware 
    - add instructions on wiring (see example connection of neopixels in lab)
    - Option: add exercise on visualizing different curve parameterizations in RGB cube

Color Lab 2:
    - remove solutions to exercises

Color Lab 3: quantization
    - remove solutions to exercises

Color Lab 4: rgb sensor project 
    - add instructions for wiring

Color Lab 5: edge detection
    - remove solutions to exercises

Pedometer Lab:
    - add instructions on wiring (see Calc2 labs)
    - remove solutions to exercises

Motion Tracking Lab:

    - add instructions on wiring 
    - Option: add exercise to compare vector field before/after smoothening

Planimeter Lab:
    - add pictures of hardware 
    - add instructions on wiring

Integration Lab:
    - add instructions on wiring (see Calc2 labs)
