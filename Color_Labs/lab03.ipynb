This is one form of color quantization since there are infinitely many colors and we've reduced that down to about 16.7 million. In many applications, further quantization is necessary. Quantization is used for image compression by reducing the information of an image so that it requires less storage, and some devices like phones or printers only support a certain palette of colors. \n",

    "Consider the game of \"guess how many jellybeans (or other small objects) are in the jar\". This game would be very uninteresting if there were only 4 jellybeans in the jar. We would have a much harder time visually distinguishing between 140 and 141 jellybeans, but there is some threshold where, say, 180 jellybeans looks noticeably different from 140 jellybeans. If you've been in a psychology class, you may have heard of [Weber's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law), which quantifies human perception in response to a stimulus like an increase in jellybeans. Weber's Law suggests that this threshold is proportional to the relative stimulus increment. In other words, if $dV$ is a just perceivable difference in the amount of jellybeans $J$, then for a constant $\\alpha$, $\n",
